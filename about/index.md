I'm an undergrad at the University of Auckland in my second year of studying CS. I have been obssessively learning about neural networks and AI in my spare time since I first saw [DeepDream](https://research.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html) in mid 2015. Now I've absorbed enough knowledge from MOOCs and implementing stuff that I want to share my projects with the world.

If one of my posts has a mistake, or if you have a question about something, please go ahead and contact me at the reverse of zn.ca.inudnalkcua@390uobs.
